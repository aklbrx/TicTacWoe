I created this project to learn Ruby on Rails, so it's very rough. You have been warned.

Create a game by accessing the index and choosing a mark, then share the link with someone else 
to challenge them. You do not have to create an account. A session cookie is created for the host
of the game, and the first person to join that game gets a session cookie too.
